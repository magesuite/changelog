<h2>New feature in changelog extension!</h2>
<p>Sometimes, your feature or change is more complex - sometimes it requires additional guidelines, explanation about configuration or way of working.</p>
<p>Till now, changelog only allowed to include small, brief notifications about introduced changes.</p>
<p>This is about to change with new feature, which allows developers and agencies to propagate additional content through admin panel.</p>
<h4>ðŸ’¡ For developers:</h4>
<p>When you create changelog entry in <code>changelog.xml</code> - you may now add extra node:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;tag&gt;
    &lt;type&gt;FEATURE&lt;/type&gt;
    &lt;overview&gt;New feature coming in!&lt;/overview&gt;
    &lt;doc_reference&gt;markdown_file_with_additional_information&lt;/doc_reference&gt;
&lt;/tag&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Then, simply create markdown file in folder <code>/doc</code> (in root directory of your extension) and place there a file (in above case: <code>markdown_file_with_additional_information.MD</code>) - keep in mind to add .MD extension.
When changelog is rendered, Markdown content will be parsed to HTML and displayed accordingly.</p>
<p>You can see how this very page is created in <a href="https://github.com/magesuite/changelog">magesuite-changelog</a> extension.</p>
<h4>Some things to keep in mind:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Images can be included, however with absolute URLs only</li>
<li>Feel free to use lists, code snippets and all other directives provided by Markdown syntax</li>
</ul>
